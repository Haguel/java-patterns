# Java Design Patterns Showcase ðŸŽ¨

This project is a collection of common design patterns implemented in Java. Each pattern is demonstrated with a practical example based on tasks and explanations provided during a learning session. The goal is to understand the core principles and application of these patterns.
The tasks for the tasks were generated by AI.

## Implemented Design Patterns âœ¨

This project currently includes implementations for the following design patterns:

1.  **Singleton**
    * Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
    * Task and details: [`src/main/java/dev/haguel/patterns/singleton/singleton-task.md`](src/main/java/dev/haguel/patterns/singleton/singleton-task.md)
2.  **Factory Method**
    * Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
    * Task and details: [`src/main/java/dev/haguel/patterns/factory/factory-task.md`](src/main/java/dev/haguel/patterns/factory/factory-task.md)
3.  **Builder**
    * Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
    * Task and details: [`src/main/java/dev/haguel/patterns/builder/builder-task.md`](src/main/java/dev/haguel/patterns/builder/builder-task.md)
4.  **Strategy**
    * Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
    * Task and details: [`src/main/java/dev/haguel/patterns/strategy/strategy-task.md`](src/main/java/dev/haguel/patterns/strategy/strategy-task.md)
5.  **Decorator**
    * Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
    * Task and details: [`src/main/java/dev/haguel/patterns/decorator/decorator-task.md`](src/main/java/dev/haguel/patterns/decorator/decorator-task.md)
6.  **Observer**
    * Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
    * Task and details: [`src/main/java/dev/haguel/patterns/observer/observer-task.md`](src/main/java/dev/haguel/patterns/observer/observer-task.md)
